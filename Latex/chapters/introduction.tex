You only need to do this in the end for the last milestone.

Study the fundamental cosmology of our Universe and its early evolution, from right after inflation to the present day at very large scales. Doing this predicts the existence and behaviour of a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which we can study the physical properties of.

The goal of this whole project is to be able to predict the CMB (and matter) fluctuations - described by the so-called power-spectrum - from first principles and learn about all the different physical processes that goes on to be able to explain the results. 

Use SI units in project, equations need to have actual units
