\section{Conclusions}

   \begin{enumerate}
      \item The conditions for the stability of static, radiative
         layers in gas spheres, as described by Baker's (\citeyear{baker})
         standard one-zone model, can be expressed as stability
         equations of state. These stability equations of state depend
         only on the local thermodynamic state of the layer.
      \item If the constitutive relations -- equations of state and
         Rosseland mean opacities -- are specified, the stability
         equations of state can be evaluated without specifying
         properties of the layer.
      \item For solar composition gas the $\kappa$-mechanism is
         working in the regions of the ice and dust features
         in the opacities, the $\mathrm{H}_2$ dissociation and the
         combined H, first He ionization zone, as
         indicated by vibrational instability. These regions
         of instability are much larger in extent and degree of
         instability than the second He ionization zone
         that drives the Cephe{\"\i}d pulsations.
