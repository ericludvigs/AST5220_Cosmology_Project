\section{Conclusions}

This project provides a brisk walk through some important results for modern cosmology, but unfortunately falls short of finally getting the CMB power spectrum working. 

   \begin{enumerate}
      \item The CMB power spectrum is an important tool for probing various cosmological parameters and both large-scale physics as well as early evolution of our universe.
      \item Inflation is needed to source the distribution of matter in a way that can resemble our current universe.
      \item Dark matter is needed to explain not just galaxy rotation curves, but also the overall behaviour of the CMB and matter power spectrums, along with effects like baryon dragging. Dark matter is not a simple numerical artifact but fundamentally needed to understand the development of modern cosmological models.
      \item Array wrangling of complex implicit objects in Milestone III is not fun.
   \end{enumerate}
